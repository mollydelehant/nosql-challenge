# nosql-challenge

I got help from two peers on this prjoect, Joseph DeVito and Nathan Rosenberg.

For questions that my peers couldn't help with, I used online resources to support my code. 

I initally had some issues with the pymongo import on the analysis starter file so I moved all of my code onto one document located in the folder nosql-challenge/Starter Code'NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb - nosql-challenge'. It is the most recent update on my repo.
