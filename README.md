# nosql-challenge

I got help from two peers on this prjoect, Joseph DeVito and Nathan Rosenberg.

For questions that my peers couldn't help with, I used online resources to support my code. 

I initally had some issues with the pymongo import on the analysis starter file so I moved all of my code onto one document 'NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb - nosql-challenge' this is located in the starter code folder on my repo.
